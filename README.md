# HackerRankProblems
A collection of HackerRank problems I have completed and attempted.

A collection of some of the problems I have completed on HackerRank, specifically from the interview preparation kit. For each problem I've provided my solution(s) which may or may not have worked for various reasons, and the given solution if it differed from mine, or if I didn't find a way to complete the problem.

My biggest challenges completing most of these problems were finding ways to reduce the time complexity of my code, as I often ran into runtime errors. Overcoming these problems taught me how to more efficiently use HashMaps, and come up with clever solutions to deceivingly difficult problems.
